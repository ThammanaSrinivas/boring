Tip -5 : Find and replace by hand
         This is useful for simple one line substitutions 
         use ; and . combo ( ; repeats prev search and . repeats cw )
         ( note : ":s is really good" )

Tip - 6: Meet the dot formula
         The ideal : One keystroke to move + One keystroke to execute
         Example   :          j            +          .
                              ;            +          .
                              n            +          .

Note : Many normal mode command can be used with count


                            NORMAL MODE


Tip -7: Pause with your brush off the page
        go to normal mode 
            1) if necessary
            2) you need to rest

Tip -8: Chunk your undo
        In vim undo represents " recent change " (visual included)
        
        So go to normal mode sometimes to chunk undos
