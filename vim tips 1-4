Week 1 : 

Tip -1 : The dot command
    the dot command repeats the "last change" ( note the word change )
    Note : even the change done during the insert mode counts

>G increases the indentation from the current line to the end of the line

Tip -2 : Don't repeat yourself

Two for the price of one :
    C = c$
    s = cl
    S = ^C
    I = ^i
    A = $a
    o = A<CR>
    O = ko

Tip -3 : Take one step back, then three forward
         this tip is useful for change

Tip -4 : Act, repeat and reverse
    ; = repeats the previous f { char }
    , = repeats the previous f { char } in reverse way
    this also works for t { char }

    here the f { char } is the act
    ; is the repeat
    and , is the reverse if things get messy
